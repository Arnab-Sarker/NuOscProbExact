# NuOscProbExact
Code to compute exact two- and three-neutrino oscillation probabilities using SU(2) and SU(3) expansions


## What is NuOscProbExact?

NuOscProbExact is a Python implementation of the method to compute exact two-flavor and three-flavor neutrino oscillation probabilities for arbitrary time-independent Hamiltonians presented in 1904.XXXXX.  The method relies on expansions of the Hamiltonian and time-evolution operators in terms of SU(2) and SU(3) matrices in order to obtain concise, analytical, and exact expressions for the probabilities, that are also easy to implement and evaluate.  For details of the method, see the paper above.

NuOscProbExact was developed by Mauricio Bustamante.  If you use NuOscProbExact in your work, please cite the paper above.  Find more information about citing here.
