# NuOscProbExact
Code to compute exact two- and three-neutrino oscillation probabilities using SU(2) and SU(3) expansions


## What is NuOscProbExact?

**NuOscProbExact** is a Python implementation of the method to compute exact two-flavor and three-flavor neutrino oscillation probabilities for arbitrary time-independent Hamiltonians presented in the paper [arXiv:1904.XXXXX](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.XXXXX).  The method relies on expansions of the Hamiltonian and time-evolution operators in terms of SU(2) and SU(3) matrices in order to obtain concise, analytical, and exact expressions for the probabilities, that are also easy to implement and evaluate.  For details of the method, see the paper above.

**NuOscProbExact** was developed by Mauricio Bustamante, who also authored the paper [arXiv:1904.XXXXX](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.XXXXX).  If you use NuOscProbExact in your work, please follow the directions on [Citing](#citing).


## Requirements

**NuOscProbExact** is fully written in Python 3.  It uses standard modules that are available, sometimes by default, as part of most Python installations, either stand-alone or via Anaconda:

* The two core modules (`oscprob2nu.py` and `oscprob3nu.py`) require only `numpy` and `cmath`.  These are the bare minimum requirements.

* The modules containing example Hamiltonians (`hamiltonians2nu.py` and `hamiltonians3nu.py`) require only `numpy`, `cmath`, and `copy`

* The modules containing the test suites (`oscprob2nu_tests.py`, `oscprob3nu_tests.py`, `oscprob3nu_plotpaper.py`, and `oscprob_testsuite.py`) require only `numpy`, `cmath`, `copy`, and `matplotlib`


## Installation

Because **NuOscProbExact** is written fully in Python, no compilation or linking is necessary.  The installation amounts to fetching the files from GitHub and is simple.

1. In the file system where you would like to install **NuOscProbExact**, go to the directory where you would like the code to be downloaded, *e.g.*,
   ```shell
   cd /home/MyProjects
   ```
2. From there, fetch the code from the GitHub repository with
   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/mbustama/NuOscProbExact.git
   ```
   (Alternatively, you can download the zip file from GitHub and uncompress it.)
   Doing this will create the directory `/home/MyProjects/NuOscProbExact`, with the following file structure:
   ```
   /NuOscProbExact/run_testsuite.py    Run this to create test plots of the probabilities
   /NuOscProbExact/fig                 Contains plots generate by the test suite (initially empyty)
   /NuOscProbExact/src                 Contains the main source files
       ../hamiltonians2nu.py           Routines to compute example two-flavor Hamiltonians
       ../hamiltonians3nu.py           Routines to compute example three-flavor Hamiltonians
       ../globaldefs.py                Physical constants
       ../oscprob2nu.py                Routines to compute the two-flavor probabilities
       ../oscprob3nu.py                Routines to compute the three-flavor probabilities
   /NuOscProbExact/test                Contains the source files to run the test suite
       ../matplotlibrc                 Customized matplotlib style file
       ../oscprob3nu_plotpaper.py      Routine to generate the plot shown in the paper
       ../oscprob3nu_tests.py          Routines to generate three-flavor probability tests plots
   ```
   Now you are ready to start using **NuOscProbExact**.
3. (Optional) Run the test suite
   ```shell
   cd /home/MyProjects/NuOscProbExact
   python run_testsuite.py
   ```
   Doing this will create plots of the probabilities *vs.* distance and *vs.* energy, for different oscillation scenarios.  The plots will be stored in the `NuOscProbExact/fig` directory.  The plots are generated by the source files located in the `NuOscProbExact/test/` directory.  Inspecting these files may help you in coding your own project.


## Quick start

## Documentation and help

All of the modules provided in **NuOscProbExact** have been documented using Python docstrings.  These are human-readable by opening the source `.py` files.  Alternatively, they can be printed from within an interactive Python session.

To view the documentation of a module from within an interactive Python session, run, *e.g.*,
```python
import oscprob3nu

print(oscprob3nu.__doc__)
```
This will print to screen a description of what the module does (in this example, `oscprob3nu`) and a list of the functions that it contains, including a description of each.

To view the documentation of a particular function from within an interactive Python session, run, *e.g.*,
```python
import oscprob3nu

help(oscprob3nu.hamiltonian_3nu_coefficients)
```
This will print to screen a description of what the function does (in this example, `oscprob3nu.hamiltonian_3nu_coefficients`), a list and description of its input parameters, and a description of the values that it returns.
